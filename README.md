## Reusable H3 PMTiles
The introduction of globe support in MapLibre GL JS has successfully solved many of the projection challenges in web mapping. Nevertheless, we still face difficulties related to zoom levels and the clarity of displayed information. To improve the user experience at various zoom levels, we plan to implement a strategy of weaving together H3 grids with differing resolutions. This approach should allow for more detailed and accurate map displays, regardless of the zoom level.
